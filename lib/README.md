This folder should contain the library files needed to build the Adapters.

Please drop here binary files of the Lightstreamer .NET Standard Adapters Server library from NuGet [Lightstreamer.DotNetStandard.Adapters](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lightstreamer.DotNetStandard.Adapters/) and add them as a reference for the project.
More simply, you could use directly the "NuGet Package Manager" looking for 'Lightstreamer Adapters' and install the Lightstreamer.DotNetStandard.Adapters package.

To support logging facilities, you should copy here the `log4net.dll` file, too.
