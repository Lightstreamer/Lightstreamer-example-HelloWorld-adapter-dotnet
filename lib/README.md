This folder should contain the library files needed to build the Adapters.

Please drop here the `DotNetAdapter_N2.dll` file from the Lightstreamer .NET Adapter Library, you can find it in `LS_HOME/DOCS-SDKs/sdk_adapter_dotnet/lib`.

To support logging facilities, you should copy here the `log4net.dll` file, too.
